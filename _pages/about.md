## Me

I currently work for a bank in the UK, specifically working in the area of APIs and integration. I use a pragmatic blend of APIs, EDA, ESBs, REST, SOA, Web Services and more to connect and integrate systems. The contents of this site are entirely my own and do not represent the views or opinions of my employer.

## My Why

Simon Sinek's "Start with Why" and "Find your Why" messages resonate with me.

So I tried to define my why:

> To find the best quality, affordable solutions so the pain of low quality does not outlast the joy of low price.
