**Welcome to 2020.**

Why the tagline “**the pain of low quality far outlasts the joy of low price**”?  Well it’s a motto I try to live by. It comes from a Benjamin Franklin Quote:

I'm an IT Architect, so like to express things in code too:
```java
len(pain(this.quality)) > len(joy(this.price))
```
In Simon Sinek's book [Find Your Why](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Find-Your-Why-Practical-Discovering/dp/0241279267) he suggests a simple structure with which to express your purpose, cause, or the belief that drives you. Your "WHY" is what sets you apart from everyone else. It’s what inspires you to take action. Your "WHY" is also what inspires others to take action - to spread your ideas, or buy your products.

This simple structure is a clear, actionable statement focused on how you contribute and expressed in affirmative language that resonates with you.  Your "WHY" statement follows the style

> ``To _____ So _____``

My "WHY" is:

> To find the best quality, affordable solutions so the pain of low quality does not outlast the joy of low price.
