A number of years ago (quite a few now) I wrote myself an abridged guide to UML. I found Krutchen's ["4+1 Architectural View Model"](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf) useful. The UML maps it's diagrams onto this model reasonably well.

I make my guide available as a collection of pages [here](/uml2). This collection of pages present an abridged combination of [The UML User Guide](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1088874) and [The UML Reference Manual](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/993859) books, taking an 80-20 approach to The UML (80% of designs can be described using 20% of the UML). Refer to the published books for an in-depth understanding of The UML.

I still use (somewhat loosely) about 20% of The UML to document systems - mostly [sequence diagrams](/uml2/behavioural-diagrams.html#sequence-diagrams) and [component diagrams](/uml2/structural-classification.html#component-diagrams).

I use a mixture of Krutchen's [4+1 Architecture View Model](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf) and Rozanski & Woods' [Software Systems Architecture](https://www.viewpoints-and-perspectives.info/) for viewpoints and perspectives - along with the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) to identify levels of abstraction.

You may find this [UML](/uml2) collection useful. I hope you do.
