I have made some progress with [Uncle Bob](https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/T-800_(T2)) as I now call him. I would have liked to have done more, but other priorities (like family holidays) were needed.

I've started to call him Uncle Bob rather than "he" or "it". The name "Arnie" didn't fit right. John Connor introduced him as "Uncle Bob" to [Enrique Salceda](https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/Enrique_Salceda) in Terminator 2 Judgement Day. Calling it "he" probably means I should think up a name for him. "Arnie" sounds unoriginal.
