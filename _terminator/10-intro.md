My favourite film is James Cameron's 1984 cult movie [The Terminator](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/) with its iconic [T-800 Endoskeleton](https://terminator.fandom.com/wiki/T-800), played (until his skin is burnt off in a burning tanker cab) by Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[Agora Models](https://www.agoramodels.com/) offer a number of high-spec, detailed models to build; [cars](https://www.agoramodels.com/shelby-cobra/), [ships](https://www.agoramodels.com/bismarck/), [planes](https://www.agoramodels.com/zero/), even [remote-controlled tanks](https://www.agoramodels.com/leopard/).

One of the models available is the official half-scale model of the [Terminator T-800 Endoskeleton](https://www.agoramodels.com/terminator-t-800/).

The model had been released for a while. It is available in a 12-month subscription (one box per month) and 24-month too. Also available are accelerator packs, such as six boxes initial followed by a further six boxes, one per month.

The full kit is now available, but not back in March. I opted for the six-month accelerator.

I didn't want to make them all immediately, but neither did I want to make a box and then have to wait a month for the next installment. The "all episodes available now" approach on Netflix and iPlayer has changed the way we consume subscriptions. With six boxes up front, I would at least have the next box on hand ready to start.
