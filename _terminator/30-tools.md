Model assembly needs some tools, only some of which were in my toolbox.

Pack-1 Stage 01 (Components for the Head and Eyes) lists each model part required and suggests a small cross-point screwdriver (Phillips PH00 or similar), so off to Amazon to see what they have for PH00.

I ended up buying [this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07B7RRWQR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00) for less than a fiver.

Along with the PH00 cross-point screwdriver, I have found myself also using:

* __Scissors__ to cut open the packs of screws.
* A __Ramekin dish__ to pour the screws and other small parts in. Also a nice holder for the cocktail stick.
* A __cocktail stick__ to squeeze a drop of glue onto then apply sparingly and with great accuracy. This is advised in the instruction manual.
* __Superglue__ is required at various points throughout the build.
* A __small craft knife__ to cut pieces (such as teeth) away from their moldings.
* I find __small wire-cutters__ a useful alternative to the craft knife. Cutting with the back of the blade gets very close to the item. I switch between the craft knife and wire-cutters.
* A __small file__ to smooth off the cutting points.
* I also find __small round-nodes pliers__ (those with curved ends) to place the small nuts into recesses
* __Tweezers__ also help drop nuts and screws into hard to reach locations.
* A __Cutting Mat__ to work on. I had one from [Hobby Craft](https://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/self-healing-cutting-mat-a3/572007-1000).
* Along the way, Agora provide a __small Allen key__ for various fixings.

To help with finer work, I also found I needed a helping hand magnifying glass ([similar to this one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rolson-Tools-60335-Helping-Magnifying/dp/B001BMSBD4)). With its arms, it looks like a mini-terminator. Kind of like a T-0.1.
