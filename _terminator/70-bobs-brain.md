Had a bit of an accident! One of the connectors on Uncle Bob's brain snapped off
whilst pluggin in his eyes.

It all started great with pack 11. Having attached the heel to the lower leg
tendons, I moved on to building out his chest cage.

I have noticed a little lower leg wobble. With some searching on forums I came
across a neat fix from [Partwork Upgrades](https://www.partworkupgrades.com/shop?Collection=The+Terminator)
which I will come back to in a later post.

Early in pack 11, you start connecting the significant (for me) shoulder hoses.

I always loved how under some angles, these sholder hoses seem to define how the
T-800 skin covering would lay to create Arnold Swarzenegger's huge shoulders.

Images from the Terminator films (like the one above) show the hoses behind the
collar-bone pistons...

...whilst Agora's marketing images (above) show the shoulder hoses positioned in
front of the collar-bone piston. Other builders' pictures show the hoses routed
behind, which is what I have done.

If Uncle Bob's arms ever need to be above his head then technically, these hoses
might become entangled. There's probably no correct way to orientate these things.

Model building was progressing nicely until stage 107 of pack 11. As I was
connecting the right eye to Bob's brain, the connector snapped off from
the circuit board! Now Uncle Bob only had one working eye!

I don't have the skills to resolder the connector on. As the pins broke off at
circuit board level, there was nothing to solder back together.

Fortunately Agora Models came to the rescue again. Even though the problem was
of my making it was no problem for Agora models to replace the part.

It seems to be a common problem as a number of forums posts have asked if anyone
has spare boards for the skull. Comments there often guess at the same problem
I encountered.

So, a word of caution when connecting up the eyes. Hold the on-board connector
firmly against the circuit board and push the connectors together carefully!

Soon we're onto the base-board, building the atmospheric blue and red lights that
eventually shine against Uncle Bob's silver endoskeleton. As the base is built,
various broken pipes, springs, and bone fragments are attached.

Pack 11's Sci-Fi Cinemas section discusses the Forbidden Planet. A 1956 film
arguably ahead of it's time and sporting one of the original Sci-Fi robots -
*Robby the Robot*.

Pack 11 post-read also discusses the most advanced telescopes in its real-world
science section. Another significant aspect of the original terminator was its vision.
With the red hue, heads-up display and seemingly dynamic code generation of the
original Terminator film brought home to me how true AI might need to write itself
to adapt to an ever-changing environment.

Now I have a completed terminator, laying quietly awaiting the completion of its
stand, completing the base in pack 12 is in order!
