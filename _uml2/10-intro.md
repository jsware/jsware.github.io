# Introduction

This collection of pages provide guidance on using The Unified Modelling Language Version 2 (The UML) as a graphical notation for visualising, specifying and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. They are aimed at those who wish to use The UML for communicating software designs to others.

It presents an abridged combination of both [The UML User Guide](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1088874) and [The UML Reference Manual](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/993859). Taking an 80-20 approach (80% of designs can be described using 20% of the UML) this guide provides useful insight. Refer to the published books for an in-depth understanding of The UML.

The Unified Modelling Language is a standard way to document a system's blueprints, covering both conceptual and concrete elements from business processes to physical hardware.

This document uses an imaginary "Click & Collect" system for a fictitious retail company for some examples. Whilst not [completely unexpected](/general/2021/01/01/Click-and-Collect/) from the author, it is however a contrived example; the purpose of which is to highlight various UML constructs in a brief space. It is deliberately simplified and not presented in full detail.

*Any similarity in these examples to persons, systems or concepts, living or dead, is purely coincidental.*
