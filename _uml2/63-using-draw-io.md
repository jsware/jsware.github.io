Draw.IO is now called [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/). It is an excellent cross-platform diagramming tool with an online version and downloadable application.

Backwards compatibility for diagrams is a key feature of Draw.IO. "Diagram files created in 2005 will load in the app today" is a key message on their web site.

Draw.IO rivals commercial options such as Visio. Draw.IO comes with a full set of UML 2 and UML 2.5 symbols.

There is also a Visual Studio Code plugin that allows Draw.IO diagrams to be edited directly in your IDE. See [Henning Dieterichs'](https://github.com/hediet) GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio) for details including installation instructions.

This Draw.IO plugin for VS Code can edit `*.drawio`, `*.drawio.png` and `*.drawio.svg` files. The later two generate images viewable directly in a browser.

Many of the illustrations in this collection use drawio.svg files to generate the image, along with [PlantUML](using-platuml.html).
